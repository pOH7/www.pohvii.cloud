## Testing Our Comment System

This is a test blog post to verify that our Giscus comment system is working correctly with the new self-healing URL implementation.

### What We're Testing

1. **Comment Loading**: The Giscus widget should load properly at the bottom of this post
2. **Discussion Mapping**: The GitHub discussion should map to this post ID (`795aade4`) via `mapping="specific"`
3. **Self-Healing URLs**: The comment system should work even if we change the title or slug of this post

### How Giscus Works

Giscus is a lightweight comments widget built on GitHub Discussions. When configured with `mapping="specific"` and `term` set to the post ID, it will:

- Search for an existing GitHub discussion mapped to that term
- If no discussion exists, create one automatically when the first comment is posted
- Display all comments from that discussion as blog comments

### Testing Instructions

1. Scroll down to the comment section
2. Try posting a test comment (requires GitHub login)
3. Check that a new discussion is created in the configured category
4. Verify that the comment appears both in the blog and in the GitHub discussion

This approach ensures our comments remain tied to the post even if we rename the file or change the title, thanks to the unique post ID system.

## Conclusion

If you can see the comment section below and successfully post a comment, our integration is working perfectly!
