## Testing Our Comment System

This is a test blog post to verify that our Utterances comment system is working correctly with the new self-healing URL implementation.

### What We're Testing

1. **Comment Loading**: The Utterances widget should load properly at the bottom of this post
2. **Issue Term**: The GitHub issue should be created using our post ID (`795aade4`) as the issue term
3. **Self-Healing URLs**: The comment system should work even if we change the title or slug of this post

### How Utterances Works

Utterances is a lightweight comments widget built on GitHub issues. When configured with `issue-term` set to a specific term (in our case, the post ID), it will:

- Search for an existing GitHub issue with that term in the title
- If no issue exists, create a new one automatically when the first comment is posted
- Display all comments from that issue as blog comments

### Testing Instructions

1. Scroll down to the comment section
2. Try posting a test comment (requires GitHub login)
3. Check that a new issue is created in the repository with the title containing `795aade4`
4. Verify that the comment appears both in the blog and in the GitHub issue

This approach ensures our comments remain tied to the post even if we rename the file or change the title, thanks to the unique post ID system.

## Conclusion

If you can see the comment section below and successfully post a comment, our integration is working perfectly!
