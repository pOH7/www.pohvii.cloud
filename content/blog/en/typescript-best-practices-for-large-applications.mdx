## Introduction to TypeScript at Scale

TypeScript has become the de facto standard for building large-scale JavaScript applications. Its static type system helps catch errors early, improves code maintainability, and enhances developer productivity through better tooling and IDE support.

## Project Structure and Organization

A well-organized project structure is crucial for large TypeScript applications. Consider using a modular approach with clear separation of concerns.

### Recommended Folder Structure:

- `src/` - Source code directory
- `types/` - Type definitions
- `utils/` - Utility functions
- `components/` - Reusable components
- `services/` - API and business logic

## Type Safety Best Practices

Leverage TypeScript's type system to create robust, maintainable code that prevents common runtime errors.

### Enable Strict Mode

Always use strict mode in your TypeScript configuration to catch potential issues early in development.

## Performance Considerations

Large TypeScript projects require careful attention to compilation performance and bundle size optimization.

## Conclusion

Following these TypeScript best practices will help you build scalable, maintainable applications that can grow with your team and requirements.
