title: Set System Volume on Startup
description: Automatically set system volume to a specific level when Windows starts
---

This example shows how to automatically set your system volume to a specific level when Windows starts.

## Steps

### 1. Create a PowerShell Script

Create a file at the following location:

```
C:\Tools\SetVolume.ps1
```

Add this content to the file:

```powershell
& "C:\Tools\nircmd-x64\nircmd.exe" setsysvolume 32768
```

> **Note:** The value `32768` sets the volume to 50%. You can adjust this value:
>
> - `0` = mute
> - `65535` = 100% volume
> - `32768` = 50% volume

### 2. Create a Startup Shortcut

Open the Startup folder by pressing `Win+R` and typing:

```
shell:startup
```

Create a new shortcut with the following target:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Tools\SetVolume.ps1"
```

## How It Works

When Windows starts, the shortcut in the Startup folder will run the PowerShell script, which executes NirCmd to set the system volume to your desired level.
